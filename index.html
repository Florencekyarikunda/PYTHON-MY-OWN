    <p>How to install python,Type sudo apt install python3.9,type password which is student,then there y/n but type y which is yes because you want to install but if you dont want to install,type n which means no.Secondly >>>,these shows that they are just waiting the use to give it what to do.To add on that,about python operators ifyou want to do operations,type 3+4 and it doesnot give directly an answer but press ctrl+z and type clear,then write python3,type 3+4 the answer will be 7.Thirdly coparison operators  compares values and returns a boolean answer, forexample true or falselike3!=3False,3!=4True.about intergers and floats:3.0 is an interger but 3 is a float. </p>
    Arithmetic Operators
    These operators are mainly used in performing different mathematical operations(Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division, and some more).
    
    The “+” operator
    This allows us to add two variables or more and give us the summed value of these variables. Let’s see the following example:
    
    Code:
    1
    2
    3
    4
    a = 5
    b = 10
    c = a + b
    print(c)
    Output:
    15
    
    Explanation:
    Simply the variable c has the summed value of the variables a & b after adding them.
    
    The “-” operator
    This allows us to subtract two or more variables and gives us the result of this operation. Let’s see the following example:
    
    Code:
    1
    2
    3
    4
    a = 5
    b = 10
    c = b - a
    print(c)
    Output:
    5
    
    Explanation:
    Same as in the Addition operation the variable c holds the subtracted value of the variables b & a after subtracting them.
    
    The “*” operator
    This one is used in multiplying several variables or values together. Let’s check the following example:
    
    Code:
    1
    2
    3
    4
    a = 5
    b = 10
    c = a * b * 3
    print(c)
    Output:
    150
    
    Explanation:
    You can see here that this operator helped us multiplying the variables a & b and the value 3 together.
    
    The “/” & “//” operators
    Both operators perform the same operation which is dividing variables and values, but the double backslash rounds the result to the smaller whole number(floor). Let’s explain this by an example:
    
    Code:
    1
    2
    3
    4
    5
    6
    a = 5
    a = 5
    b = 11
    c = b / a
    d = b // a
    print(d)
    Output:
    2.2
    2
    
    Explanation:
    As you can see both operators performed the same operation(division), however, the double backslash operator rounded the number to the floor value which in this example is 2.
    
    The “%” operator
    This operator helps us find the remainder of dividing two variables or values together. Let’s see the following example:
    
    Code:
    1
    2
    3
    4
    5
    6
    7
    a = 6
    b = 12
    c = 13
    d = b % a
    e = c % a
    print(d)
    print(e)
    Output:
    0
    1
    
    Explanation:
    As you can see the result of d is equal to zero because there is no remainder when you divide 12 by 6, however, the result of d is equal to one as this is the remainder when you divide 13 by 6.
    
    The “**” operator
    This operator helps us perform the power operation, it returns the first variable raised to the power of the second variable. Let’s see the following example:
    
    Code:
    1
    2
    3
    4
    a = 2
    b = 3
    c = a ** b
    print(c)
    Output:
    8
    
    Comparison, or Relational Operators
    These kinds of operators help us to compare operands and values. They always return True or False, depending on the condition.
    
    The “>” operator
    The greater than the operator and it returns True if and only if the left value or operand is greater than the right one. Let’s see an example:
    
    Code:
    1
    2
    3
    4
    5
    a = 2
    b = 3
    c = 4
    print( c > b)
    print( a > b)
    Output:
    True
    False
    
    Explanation:
    As you can see when the condition is satisfied in the first comparison the output was True, on the other hand when the left operand was less than the right one it returned False.
    
    The “<” operator
    The less than an operator and it only returns True if the left value is less than the right value. Let’s see an example:
    
    Code:
    1
    2
    3
    4
    5
    a = 2
    b = 3
    c = 4
    print( b < c)
    print( b < a)
    Output:
    True
    
    False
    
    The “==” & “!=” operators
    The “==” is the Equal to the operator and it only returns True if both values are equal. On the contrary the “!=” is the Not Equal to the operator and it only returns True if both values are not equal. Let’s see an example:
    
    Code:
    1
    2
    3
    4
    5
    6
    7
    a = 2
    b = 2
    c = 4
    print(a == b)
    print(a == c)
    print(a != c)
    print(a != b)
    Output:
    True
    
    False
    
    True
    
    False
    
    Explanation:
    As you can see the “==” operator only returns True when both operands are equal and false otherwise. And the opposite with the “!=” operator.
    
    The “ >=” operator
    This one only returns True if the left operand is equal to or greater than the right one. Let’s see an example:
    
    Code:
    1
    2
    3
    4
    5
    a = 2
    b = 2
    c = 4
    print(a >= b)
    print(a >= c)
    Output:
    True
    False
    
    The “<=” operator
    It only returns True if the left operand is less than or equal to the right one. Let’s see an example:
    
    Code:
    1
    2
    3
    4
    5
    a = 2
    b = 3
    c = 4
    print(a <= b)
    print(c <= a)
    Output:
    True
    False
    
    
    Logical Operators
    These operators are used to compare two or more conditions within a statement.
    
    The “and” operator
    Same as the logical AND, it only returns True if the two operands are True. Let’s see an example:
    
    Code:
    1
    2
    3
    4
    5
    a = 10
    b = 12
    c = 15
    print( a < b and c > b)
    print ( a > b and c > b)
    Output:
    True
    False
    
    Explanation:
    The first print statement returns True because both conditions of the and are True. But the second print statement returns False because the first condition is False as the value of a is not greater than b.
    
    The “or” operator
    Not like the and operator, the or operator is like the logical OR so only one condition needs to be True. Let’s see an example:
    
    Code:
    1
    2
    3
    4
    a = 10
    b = 12
    c = 15
    print ( a > b or c > b)
    Output:
    True
    
    Explanation:
    However the first condition is not true but the second one is, you can find the print statement returned True as the second condition is still True.
    
    The “not” operator
    This operator is used to change the returned value, if it’s True it will return False and vice versa. Let’s see an example:
    
    Code:
    1
    2
    3
    4
    a = 10
    b = 12
    c = 15
    print (not( a < b and c > b))
    Output:
    False
